[How to Play]
Drag the mouse towards the direction of where you want to aim and then press the 
spacebar to shoot a cannonball at the targets.
On the left side of the screen are settings that can change the weight of the cannonball and the
power level of how fast it will be shot out of the cannon. You can also enable wind that affects the direction of the cannonball.
There are settings for how fast the wind is and which direction you want the wind to move. (The R button is for random wind direction).
Using the sliders to change the values for power and mass will be what determines whether a target will be destroyed. 
Mass will also determine how fast the cannonball will get destroyed.
